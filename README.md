ProteinAnalyst contains several functions that can be used to analyze the amino acid content of protein sequences.  These functions can count the types of amino acids, sort them into categories, and display this information as lists, data frames, or bar graphs.

All of the functions utilize the fasta file format for inputs.  These can be found on the UniProt database.

## Installation
